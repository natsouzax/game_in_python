## About the Project
This game project was created by three students from **IF Sudeste MG - Campus Rio Pomba**: **Heitor Pereira Pinto, Natan de Souza Oliveira, and JoÃ£o Victor Lana**.  

The game was a school assignment for the **Integrated Technical Course in Computer Science**, where we had to design a game and present it to the course instructors (**Bianca Portes de Castro and Lucas Grassano Lattari**).  

The original idea was a simple text-based game, but we decided to make it more elaborate with graphics and animations, resulting in the 2D game **"The Adventures of Cleiton"**.

## About the Game
The game is inspired by **Homer's "Odyssey"**, where **Cleiton** tries to return to his homeland, Errijota.  

Before embarking, Cleiton argues with the King of the Seas, **Poseidon**, and faces various adventures over approximately 20 years until he finally reaches his homeland **Errijota**.

## Libraries Used
We used the following Python libraries to build the game:

- **Pygame:** To create the entire graphical interface and game music, from the menu to the ending.  
- **Webbrowser:** To display all the cutscenes.  
- **Random:** To generate random sound effects for the Cyclops.  
- **Math:** To make the Cyclops follow Cleiton in an attempt to defeat him.

## Note
The game is not intended for profit; it was purely an academic project that we enjoyed creating and decided to share here on GitHub.
